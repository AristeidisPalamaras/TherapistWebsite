                    <p>I am a psychologist, person-centred counsellor, as well as an EMDR and IFS-informed trauma 
                        therapist.</p>
                    <p>Before entering the field of mental health, I earned a bachelor's and a master's degree in 
                        maritime studies and spent several years working in the shipping industry. </p>
                    <p>In 2009, however, my personal journey of self-discovery led me down a new path. Thus, I went on 
                        to complete a bachelorâ€™s degree in Psychology (BSc in Psychology, Open University) and a 
                        master's degree in Person-Centred Counselling (MSc in Person-Centred Counselling, University of 
                        Strathclyde).</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I have trained in trauma therapy methods, including EMDR training from the Trauma 
                        Therapy Institute of Greece and Pre-Level One training in IFS by Dr. Alexia Rothman and 
                        Trauma2therapy.</p>
                    <p>I offer individual therapy sessions and I have facilitated personal development groups, support 
                        groups for adults with ADHD (in cooperation with ADHD Hellas), as well as groups that combine 
                        creative writing with the therapeutic process. </p>
                    <p>I have also written three book of fiction, which have been published by Kedros Publications.</p>
