                    <p>I am a psychologist, a person-centred counsellor, and a trauma therapist.</p>
                    <p>Having both a bachelor’s and a master's degree in maritime studies, I worked for several years 
                        in a shipping company.</p>
                    <p>In 2009 however, my personal quests led me down a new path. Thus, I obtained a bachelor’s degree 
                        in Psychology (BSc in Psychology, Open University) and a master's degree in Person-Centred 
                        Counselling (MSc in Person-Centred Counselling, University of Strathclyde).</p>
                    <p>I have also been trained in the trauma therapy methods of EMDR from the Trauma Therapy Institute 
                        of Greece and IFS (Pre-Level One Training) by Dr. Alexia Rothman and Trauma2therapy</p>
                    <p>I conduct individual sessions and facilitate personal development groups, as well as groups 
                        combining creative writing with the therapeutic process.</p>
                    <p>I have also written three book of fiction, which have been published by Kedros Publications.</p>
