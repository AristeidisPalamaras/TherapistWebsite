                    <p>I am a psychologist, person-centred counsellor, and trauma therapist.</p>
                    <p>Before entering the field of mental health, I earned a bachelor's and a master's degree in 
                        maritime studies and spent several years working in the shipping industry. </p>
                    <p>In 2009, however, my personal journey of self-discovery led me down a new path. Thus, I went on 
                        to complete a bachelorâ€™s degree in Psychology (BSc in Psychology, Open University) and a 
                        master's degree in Person-Centred Counselling (MSc in Person-Centred Counselling, University of 
                        Strathclyde).</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I have undertaken further specialization in trauma therapy, including EMDR training 
                        from the Trauma Therapy Institute of Greece and Pre-Level One training in IFS by Dr. Alexia 
                        Rothman and Trauma2therapy.</p>
                    <p>Today, I offer individual therapy sessions and facilitate personal development groups, as well as 
                        groups that combine creative writing with the therapeutic process.</p>
                    <p>I have also written three book of fiction, which have been published by Kedros Publications.</p>
